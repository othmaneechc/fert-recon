  description: |
    Hyperparameter grid for the transformer regressor targeting generalization issues
    observed in the baseline run (validation RMSE≈271 but test RMSE≈429). Focuses on
    optimization rate, depth, and regularization that the current training loop
    natively supports.
  base_configs:
    - ../transformer_base.yaml
